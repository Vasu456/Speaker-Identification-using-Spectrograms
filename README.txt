Speaker Identification with CNN and Data Augmentation:

This assignment focuses on speaker identification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the PTDB-TUG Dataset, which is a subset of the TIMIT dataset. The goal is to create a baseline model, add regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, and enhance the model's performance by introducing noise through audio augmentation.
